My own version of the popular game Portal, written in Java

Done as part of a final project for AP Computer Science during the end of my sophomore year in High School.

Uploaded a few years after the termination of the class for record-keeping purposes.

Feel free to let me know about any bugs / etc, though it is unlikely that this will be continued further
